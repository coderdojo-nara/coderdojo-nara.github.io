We made our Dojo original hoodie design.

On the front body, CoderDojo logo and "Fuma" which is the character of CoderDojo Nishinomiya / Umeda are printed."Fuma" is not our character, but "Fuuma" is used DojoCon Japan and we love them.
On the back, our Dojo name and logo are printed.

We made front design to share with another Dojo.  And you can design by yourself on the back.

We will share this design data as below, if you like this front design and will adopt it, we are very happy.

Layout description is only Japanese.

And there is a hidden message "**be a dot**" under the hood. 

This means, no one can guarantee the continuity of volunteer activities, but if it continues to exist as a dot, it will lead to the future. So, we mean that we are conscious of each and every one being a dot.This word was influenced by the following words of Steve Jobs.

> You can’t connect the dots looking forward; you can only connect them looking backwards. So you have to trust that the dots will somehow connect in your future.

Please put your message here instead.
